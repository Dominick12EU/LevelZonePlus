## About The Project

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/503c8c14e3b44b67a34695d60d0b0f75)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/Dominick12EU/LevelZonePlus?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Dominick12EU/LevelZonePlus&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

LevelZonePlus is a complete overhaul of LevelZone aimed at enhancing all aspects of the codebase and establishing a cleaner, more efficient development environment. Our goal is to facilitate easier plugin integration and improve overall usability. With LevelZonePlus, we're introducing a new Region system, allowing users the flexibility to operate without necessarily relying on WorldGuard. However, for those who prefer WorldGuard integration, fear not! LevelZonePlus includes seamless migration from the previous LevelZone version, ensuring no loss of stored data.
